# NEGATIVE_LIGHT

Hello there, I am a Christian, Software Engineer, Content Creator, and Gamer. I do a lot and this is just my project. I like to do a lot and that is probably why my repositories seem like they are made by a madman. I love all things FOSS and hope to build up connections between the universeres of FOSS and therefore change the world. There is much to DO so lets get going.

## What I am up to RN
Well, I am obviously posting videos on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@Negative_Light) which gets cross-posted to various areas. But I would bet you are not here for that.

Well I am currently working on making several things
1. Strema Analyzers
2. Minecraft Mods using a Multiloader
3. My website
4. How to make those fancy shield things
## Fun Things

I love the project [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md), a file-first note-taking app that is awesome. I really should make a public vault for y'all too see one day. I need to work on that
